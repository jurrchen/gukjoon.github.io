Hiya,

I'm a [T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) software engineer with experience in a wide variety of specializations. I've done backend, frontend, devops, devtools, you name it.

I do have a *deep specialization in information retrieval and real-time data flows*, particularly with graph-structured information. I'm currently open sourcing a [graph database for storing source code](https://docs.sourcescape.io). Still a work in progress, but you can check it out here:

{% include repository/repo.html repository="sourcescapeio/sourcescape" %}

Over the next two years, *I want to build up a deep understanding of web3*. As overhyped as it is, having a public place to store and compute on agreed-upon information is incredibly powerful and looks to be a potential solution to the problem of platform centralization we've created with web2. There's still a long way to go and I'm excited to join in on the journey.

Outside of work, I do some Brazilian jiu-jitsu (decent) and tennis (terrible). Everyday I mourn the loss of MF Doom. And do talk to me about AI art and its implications for creatives.
